### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Caner.
#### I'm a very passionate software engineer candidate.

I'm from Turkey and I've lived in United States over 6 years now. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like Javascript, Ruby, Python, React, Rails, as well as work in WordPress. My passion for software lies with solving problems, dreaming up new ideas, designing elegant interfaces and etc. 

I'm always curious why something isn't working the way I expect. Being curious instead of being judgemental and critical can mean the difference between the success and failure of a project.

Skills: REACT / JS /  RUBY / RAILS / HTML / CSS / POSTGRESQL / AWS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  a website for the company I'm working for! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, AWS, MySQL, Typescript 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'm happy to help others. Helping others always WIN!
